  code: 190
  name: A Just Machine - First Year Honors Seminar
  term: Fall 2019
  desc: This seminar serves as an introduction to the University Honors Program, to research opportunities and other academic resources available at the University of Kansas, and to specific disciplinary perspectives on an overarching theme. The early days of computing focusing on how computing came to be and why. We look at work by the major early computing scholars and put their work in the context of World War II. We also look a that the limitations of computing and what we know about what can and cannot be computed mechanically.
