I started this mini-project out of the ever-so-fruitful combination of boredom and curiosity.
I had been interested in developing a browser extension for a while, but I didn't have any ideas to kickstart the learning process.
But alas, the idea for {{ page.title }} came to me! 

A while back, a friend of mine showed me a smilar idea that had been implimented for his school's course search page.
I guess it stewed around in my head for a while and bubbled up in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project is completely open source and fairly simple. Have a look around, and make some changes if you want!

## About the extension

As of writing this, the core script is `scrapeProfessors()` which can be found in `ku-rmp.js`.
It uses a simple query selector to find all instances of professors on the page and grabs their `innerHTML` property.
Then, it appends their name onto a RateMyProfessors.com search query that filters school to the University of Kansas:
<pre>https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/search.jsp?queryoption=HEADER&queryBy=teacherName&schoolName=University+of+Kansas&schoolID=1117&query=</pre>

This certainly isn't the *best* way to go about this, but I want to stay legal. I extracted the endpoint necessary to get `JSON` formatted data about each professor, but I decided against implementing it. It seems like this would lie in a legal gray area and I don't want to put the effort in just to get a cease and desist letter as a reward.

If you are curious, the following endpoint will return information on a professor at the University of Kansas by substituting `{PROFNAME}` for any query:
<pre>https://solr-aws-elb-production.ratemyprofessors.com//solr/rmp/select/?solrformat=true&rows=5&wt=json&q=<strong>{PROFNAME}</strong>&rows=5&fq=schoolname_t:%22University%20of%20Kansas%22&fq=schoolid_s:1117</pre>
`&q=Jeff Lang` Returns:
