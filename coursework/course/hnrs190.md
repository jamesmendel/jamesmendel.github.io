## Introduction
In 1900, German mathematician David Hilbert published 23 mathematical problems, systematically referred to today as Hilbertâ€™s problems. This paper will focus on the effects ofone of those problems, and its relevance in computer theory and modern computing systems. The halting problem asks simple question: is it possible to know, with complete certainty, whether or not a computation is possible before attempting the computation itself? Allan Turing was notably one of the first to conclude that this is an impossible feat to accomplish.
