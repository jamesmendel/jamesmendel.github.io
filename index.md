# Hi! I'm James.
-----
Electrical engineer by trade, creative explorer by passion. I hope you find something interesting here.   
I have a range of hobbies and interests that you can find more about by exploring this website / blog (I'm not 100% sure what to call it at this point, so let's go with the combination). 

See some of the projects I've worked on on my [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) page.

I have many [hobbies]({{ site.baseurl }}/hobbies), some of which I use to help describe myself:
- Hiker
- Mechanical keyboards builder
- Music enjoyer
- Programmer
- Web designer

Interested? Look around! This site was made to journal the journey of my higher education, but posts may go back as far as my middle school days! We'll see what I can dig up from the past and and create in the present. 

Happy browsing.
