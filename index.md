# Hi! I'm James.
-----
I'm a senior at the [University of Kansas](//engr.ku.edu/){:target="_blank"} studying [Electrical Engineering](//eecs.ku.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
I have a range of hobbies and interests that you can find more about by exploring this website / blog (I'm not 100% sure what to call it at this point, so let's go with the combination). 

I am the Vice President of [KU's chapter of IEEE](https://ieee.eecs.ku.edu){:target="_blank"} and a former recipient of the [Vann Family](https://engr.ku.edu/kyle-d-vann){:target="_blank"} Future Leaders Scholarship and the Garmin Excellence Scholarship. See some of the projects I've worked on on my [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) page.

I have many [hobbies]({{ site.baseurl }}/hobbies)! They include, but are not limited to:
- Mechanical keyboards
- Music (speakers, headphones)
- 3D Printing
- Programming
- Web design

Interested? Look around! This site was made to journal the journey of my higher education, but posts may go back as far as my middle school days! We'll see what I can dig up :)

Happy browsing.
